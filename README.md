## Description 

 - The Twitter project is a React app that allows users to create and manage tweets. Users can add new tweets, which display with a user's name or as anonymous. It supports CRUD operations and uses React hooks and the Fetch API to fetch, create, update, and delete tweets. The app also features basic styling for an enhanced user experience.

## Objectives 
-  Create Tweets: Enable users to create tweets and display them as either from a specified user or as anonymous.
- Manage Tweets: Allow users to read, delete, and potentially update tweets using CRUD operations.
- Fetch Data: Use the Fetch API to retrieve tweet data from a server or mock API.
- React Hooks: Utilize React hooks such as useState and useEffect for state management and lifecycle handling.
- User Experience: Provide a simple, user-friendly interface with basic styling.

## Installation Requirements
- Git
- Node.js and npm: Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. These are necessary for running the project and managing dependencies.
